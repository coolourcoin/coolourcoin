          <h4>Finite spectrum</h4>
          <p>
            The protocol starts from a fixed, public Genesis Spectrum of
            <strong>4,096 base colours</strong>. No hidden mint. No infinite supply.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>Spectral Floor Rule</h4>
          <p>
            Each colour remembers the highest price it has ever been bought for.
            Smart contracts enforce: <strong>no sale below that floor</strong>.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>RGB team mining</h4>
          <p>
            New colours are mined only by live <strong>Red + Green + Blue</strong> teams.
            No GPUs, no hardware race — just human coordination in real time.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>Licence-based entry</h4>
          <p>
            Mining access is gated by time-limited licences on R, G and B channels.
            Licences are the main way value enters the system.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>Direct colour purchase</h4>
          <p>
            Some colours can be bought directly from the protocol at a deterministic
            price, always above expected mining cost — keeping miners and buyers aligned.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>Transparent treasury</h4>
          <p>
            A fraction of licence revenue feeds a transparent Treasury, which can
            hold colours or pay contributors. All movements are visible on-chain.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>No yield, no leverage</h4>
          <p>
            CoolourCoin does not pay interest and does not use leverage.
            It protects floors; it does not promise profit.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>Open and auditable</h4>
          <p>
            Core contract code is open-source and audit-ready. The main guarantee:
            you cannot push a colour below its own history.

      <h3>A declaration of value</h3>
      <div class="oath-text">
        <p>1. Light is not a commodity. It is the first right.</p>
        <p>2. You cannot devalue colour once it is mined with intention. Every drop of light has a memory.</p>
        <p>3. Spectral Floor = Aura of Trust. It protects value like gravity protects form.</p>
        <p>4. A colour cannot be copied, blurred, or duplicated. It exists once. And that is enough.</p>
        <p>5. Trust is not a function of money. Trust is a spectrum.</p>
        <p>6. Ownership may change, but origin does not. The discoverer’s light is forever recorded.</p>
        <p>7. Each colour holds its floor. No one shall pull it down.</p>
        <p>8. To mine a shade, you need three. Red, Green, Blue — a communion of presence.</p>
        <p>9. CoolourCoin is not a casino. It is a resting place for light.</p>
        <p>10. The rule is simple: never sell below the light it cost.</p>
