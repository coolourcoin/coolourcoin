        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>1. Finite Genesis Spectrum</h4>
          <p>
            CoolourCoin starts from a fixed, public Genesis Spectrum of
            <strong>4,096 base colours</strong>. No hidden mint. No secret supply.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>2. Spectral Floor Rule</h4>
          <p>
            Each colour stores the highest price it has ever been bought for.
            The protocol enforces: <strong>no sale below that floor</strong>.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>3. Human-coordinated mining</h4>
          <p>
            A colour can only be mined by a live <strong>RGB team</strong>:
            three people, three licences, three channels (R, G, B) online at the same time.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>4. Licence-based entry</h4>
          <p>
            Access to mining is done through <strong>time-limited licences</strong> for R, G and B.
            No GPUs, no hardware race — just presence, coordination and spectrum.
          </p>
        </article>

        <!-- Row 2 -->
        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>5. Direct colour purchase</h4>
          <p>
            Some colours can be acquired directly from the protocol at a deterministic
            price, always above the mining cost. This keeps miners and buyers in balance.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>6. Transparent treasury</h4>
          <p>
            A portion of licence revenue feeds the <strong>Treasury</strong>.
            From there, colours can be used to pay contributors or form long-term reserves.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>7. No yield, no leverage</h4>
          <p>
            CoolourCoin does not pay interest, does not auto-compound
            and does not promise any financial return. It only protects the floor.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h4>8. Open-source & verifiable</h4>
          <p>
            The contract logic is <strong>open-source</strong>, audit-ready
            and focused on one core guarantee: you cannot push a colour below its own history.
          </p>

      <h3>A declaration of value</h3>
      <div class="oath-text">
        <p>1. Light is not a commodity. It is the first right.</p>
        <p>2. You cannot devalue colour once it is mined with intention. Every drop of light has a memory.</p>
        <p>3. Spectral Floor = Aura of Trust. It protects value like gravity protects form.</p>
        <p>4. A colour cannot be copied, blurred, or duplicated. It exists once. And that is enough.</p>
        <p>5. Trust is not a function of money. Trust is a spectrum.</p>
        <p>6. Ownership may change, but origin does not. The discoverer’s light is forever recorded.</p>
        <p>7. Each colour holds its floor. No one shall pull it down.</p>
        <p>8. To mine a shade, you need three. Red, Green, Blue — a communion of presence.</p>
        <p>9. CoolourCoin is not a casino. It is a resting place for light.</p>
        <p>10. The rule is simple: never sell below the light it cost.</p>
