      <p class="page-lead">
        A finite palette of colours, a strict floor rule, and a social way to mine them.
        No leverage. No hidden tricks. Just light and rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="step-section">
      <h2>1. Genesis Spectrum — finite from day one</h2>
      <p>
        CoolourCoin starts from a <strong>Genesis Spectrum</strong> of
        <strong>4&nbsp;096 base colours</strong>. Each base colour:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>has a fixed ID, HEX / RGB code and a rarity tier,</li>
        <li>exists only once at that exact coordinate in the spectrum,</li>
        <li>can later split into sub-blocks, but origin remains traceable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are not buying a “token type”. You are buying
        <strong>one specific shade of light</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="step-section">
      <h2>2. Spectral Floor — the “never below” rule</h2>
      <p>
        For every colour, the protocol keeps a single value:
        its <strong>spectral floor</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The spectral floor is the <em>highest price ever paid</em> for that colour.</li>
        <li>Smart contracts block any sale below that floor.</li>
        <li>No admin key can bypass this rule once deployed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="quote">
        “Never sell below the light it cost.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="step-section">
      <h2>3. RGB Social Mining — three humans, one colour</h2>
      <p>
        Mining a colour requires a small <strong>RGB team</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>one Red miner (R licence),</li>
        <li>one Green miner (G licence),</li>
        <li>one Blue miner (B licence).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each miner buys a licence with a maximum channel capacity (for example R=255).
        When the protocol releases a target colour (e.g. R=100, G=30, B=200),
        the team must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>be online at the same time, from different devices,</li>
        <li>lock exactly those channel values from their licences,</li>
        <li>successfully commit the match in the time window.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The percentage of each licence used to catch that colour becomes the
        <strong>minimum value</strong> of the colour. The remaining channel capacity
        stays with the miners for future attempts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="step-section">
      <h2>4. Buying colours directly</h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone wants to mine. Some people or companies simply want to
        <strong>buy a colour directly</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interface lists available colours from the current mining band.</li>
        <li>Each colour has a direct purchase price determined by tier &amp; demand.</li>
        <li>When you buy, your price becomes the new spectral floor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This allows use cases such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>brands securing “their” colour as a treasury asset,</li>
        <li>companies gifting a corporate shade to employees,</li>
        <li>individuals choosing a colour as a long-term store of value.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="step-section">
      <h2>5. Splitting &amp; merging colour blocks</h2>
      <p>
        When a colour reaches certain value thresholds, it can be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>split</strong> into smaller sub-blocks (e.g. 1 full block → 10×10%),</li>
        <li>or <strong>merged</strong> back if someone collects all parts again.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The new block’s floor is computed as the weighted average of all parts.
        You can pay with fractions of a colour, but the protocol never forgets
        from which full block they came.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="step-section">
      <h2>6. No yield, no leverage — just a rest place for value</h2>
      <p>
        CoolourCoin does <strong>not</strong> offer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>staking rewards,</li>
        <li>promised APYs,</li>
        <li>or leverage mechanisms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Its only guarantee is:
        <strong>your colour cannot be sold below its own spectral floor</strong>.
        The rest is market, community and time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="step-section">
      <h2>7. Why it matters</h2>
      <p>
        Most crypto assets are built around speculation and variance.
        CoolourCoin is built around <strong>preservation and visibility</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>what you own is visible (a colour you can see),</li>
        <li>how far it can fall is bounded (the floor),</li>
        <li>how it is mined is social, not industrial.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is not a casino. It is <strong>an instrument of rest</strong>
        in an otherwise volatile space.
