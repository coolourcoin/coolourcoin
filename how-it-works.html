    <h1>How CoolourCoin works</h1>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>1. Fixed Genesis Spectrum</h2>
      <p>
        CoolourCoin starts from a finite, public set of <strong>4,096 base colours</strong>.
        Each colour has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a stable ID,</li>
        <li>a precise RGB / HEX value,</li>
        <li>a rarity Tier (1–4), based on distance to white,</li>
        <li>a known position inside the Genesis pyramid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No new Genesis colours can be added later. The spectrum is fixed, visible,
        and can be inspected by anyone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>2. Spectral Floor Rule</h2>
      <p>
        Every colour has a <strong>spectral floor</strong>: the highest price it has ever
        been bought for on the official marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>The contract logic is simple:</p>
      <pre class="code-block">
spectralFloor[colorId] = max(spectralFloor[colorId], lastSalePrice);

require(salePrice &gt;= spectralFloor[colorId], "Below spectral floor");
      </pre>
      <p>
        This makes each colour an asset with <strong>price memory</strong>.
        Panic selling cannot push it below its own history from inside the protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>3. RGB mining teams</h2>
      <p>
        New colours are not mined with hash power. They are mined by
        <strong>RGB teams</strong> — three people online at the same time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>one Red miner (R licence),</li>
        <li>one Green miner (G licence),</li>
        <li>one Blue miner (B licence).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each licence gives a limited channel capacity (for example 255 units of its colour)
        for a fixed time window. Together, the team chooses a target RGB triple and
        mines that exact shade.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any member disconnects and does not return within a short grace period,
        the team is dropped from that mining attempt. One team can mine only one colour
        at a time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>4. Licences and initial floor</h2>
      <p>
        Licences are the <strong>only controlled entry</strong> for new value.
      </p>
      <p>Example (simplified):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each licence costs 10 USD equivalent.</li>
        <li>A full RGB team has 3 licences → 30 USD of mining capacity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If they mine a colour using a fraction of each licence, the initial floor
        is proportional to what they actually spent. Rounded amounts (cents etc.)
        can be directed into protocol reserves to keep accounting clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        No free inflation, no hidden rewards. You get colours in proportion
        to what you put in and how you coordinate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>5. Direct colour purchase</h2>
      <p>
        Some users prefer to buy a specific colour directly — for example a
        corporate shade or a national flag combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        For selected colours, the protocol can offer <strong>direct purchase</strong>
        from a pool held by the Treasury. These prices are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>always above expected mining cost,</li>
        <li>always respecting the Spectral Floor Rule,</li>
        <li>fully visible and deterministic.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>6. Treasury and contributors</h2>
      <p>
        A defined share of licence revenue goes into a transparent Treasury.
        The Treasury may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>hold rare colours as long-term reserves,</li>
        <li>pay core contributors directly in colours,</li>
        <li>support audits, security and protocol maintenance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nobody receives yield just for holding. The protocol is designed
        as a <strong>resting place for light</strong>, not a yield farm.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>7. What CoolourCoin is not</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is not a leveraged trading platform.</li>
        <li>It does not pay interest or “APY”.</li>
        <li>It does not guarantee profit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The only guarantee is structural: a colour cannot be sold below its own floor
        inside the official protocol.
