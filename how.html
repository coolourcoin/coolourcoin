        A simple, transparent protocol that turns colours into protected digital assets.

        <h2>1. The Genesis Palette</h2>
        <p>
          The system starts from a finite set of genesis colours (e.g. 4,096 shades)
          arranged in a structured spectrum. Each colour has:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a unique ID,</li>
          <li>a precise RGB / HEX code,</li>
          <li>a tier in the spectrum (from darker to near-white).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No new genesis colours can be created. The spectrum is finite, auditable and public.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <h2>2. RGB Social Mining</h2>
        <p>
          Mining in CoolourCoin is social, not hardware-based. To mine a colour,
          three people form an RGB team:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>one holds the red licence,</li>
          <li>one holds the green licence,</li>
          <li>one holds the blue licence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When the protocol opens a mining window for a target colour
          (for example R=120, G=40, B=200), the team must be online together
          and have at least those channel values available in their licences.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <h2>3. Licences and colour value</h2>
        <p>
          Each licence has a cost in real currency and a maximum channel capacity
          (for example 255 units of R, G or B). When a team successfully mines a colour:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a part of each licence is “spent” to reach the target RGB values;
          </li>
          <li>
            the proportional cost of those used units becomes the colour’s
            initial price floor;
          </li>
          <li>
            the remaining unused units in the licences stay with the miners,
            who can join future mining rounds.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The colour is then minted as a unique on-chain asset with a
          clearly defined minimum value.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <h2>4. Spectral Floor – price protection</h2>
        <p>
          The core rule of the protocol is the Spectral Floor:
          <strong>a colour cannot be sold below the highest price it has ever reached
          on the official marketplace.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The floor is enforced in the smart contract. There are no admin backdoors
          to lower it. Once the light of a colour has been paid for, that level
          can never be undercut by any later sale.
        </p>

      <article class="step">
        <h2>5. Buying colours directly</h2>
        <p>
          Not everyone will want to mine. Some people or organisations
          will prefer to buy colours directly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            lower-tier colours (darker, more common) can be priced close to
            the expected mining cost;
          </li>
          <li>
            higher-tier colours (rare, near-white) can have premium fixed prices
            or auctions;
          </li>
          <li>
            all purchases immediately set or raise the Spectral Floor for
            that colour.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Buying directly is like claiming a specific patch of the spectrum
          without joining mining rounds.
        </p>

        <h2>6. No yield, no leverage</h2>
        <p>
          CoolourCoin does not offer staking, passive yield, leverage or
          “interest-bearing” products at the protocol level. It is intentionally
          conservative:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>no “APY” promises,</li>
          <li>no algorithmic yield systems,</li>
          <li>no built-in leverage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The focus is on value preservation and transparent ownership,
          not on speculative reward engines.
