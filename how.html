    <h1>How CoolourCoin works</h1>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>1. Genesis Spectrum</h2>
      <p>
        CoolourCoin starts from a finite, public set of <strong>4,096 base colours</strong>.
        Think of them as the first layer of a pyramid. Each colour has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a numerical ID;</li>
        <li>a precise RGB / HEX code;</li>
        <li>a Tier (1–4), based on its distance to white;</li>
        <li>a rarity level known from day one.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No new Genesis colours can be invented later. They are published once and remain the
        backbone of the protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>2. Spectral Floor Rule</h2>
      <p>
        Every colour has a <strong>spectral floor</strong>: the highest price it has ever
        been bought for (in the base currency of the chain, e.g. USDC).
      </p>
      <p>
        The core rule is enforced in the smart contract:
        <strong>no sale can be executed below that floor.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically, the contract keeps a mapping:
      </p>
      <pre class="code-block">
spectralFloor[colorId] = max(spectralFloor[colorId], lastSalePrice);
      </pre>
      <p>
        and requires, on each sale:
      </p>
      <pre class="code-block">
require(salePrice &gt;= spectralFloor[colorId], "Below spectral floor");
      </pre>
      <p>
        This is not marketing language; it is a hard rule. If the contract is live,
        the floor cannot be bypassed from inside the protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>3. Mining by RGB teams</h2>
      <p>
        Mining a new colour is not done with GPUs or hash power. It is done by
        <strong>human coordination</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To mine a colour, you need an <strong>RGB team</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>one user with a Red licence (R channel),</li>
        <li>one user with a Green licence (G channel),</li>
        <li>one user with a Blue licence (B channel).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All three must be online and connected to the mining server at the same time.
        They choose together a target colour, e.g. R=120, G=40, B=200.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each licence has a maximum channel capacity (for example 255 units of R, 255 of G, 255 of B).
        When the team successfully mines a colour:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the used part is consumed from their licences (R-=120, G-=40, B-=200);</li>
        <li>the colour is minted to the team and assigned an initial floor equal
            to the fraction of licence value they used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If any member disconnects and does not return within the safety window,
        the team is dropped from that mining round and the colour remains unclaimed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>4. Licences and value</h2>
      <p>
        Mining licences are <strong>the only entry point</strong> where fresh value
        enters the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One licence per channel costs 10 USD equivalent.</li>
        <li>A full RGB team (R + G + B) has 30 USD of mining capacity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a team mines a colour using a part of their channels, the initial
        floor of that colour is proportional to the fraction of licence capacity they spent.
      </p>
      <p>
        No subsidy, no inflation, no hidden rewards: the protocol only redistributes
        what users put in, and protects the lowest price each colour has seen.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>5. Direct purchase of colours</h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone wants to mine. Some users or companies may want to
        <strong>acquire a specific colour directly</strong> — for example, the exact shade
        used in their logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The protocol can expose a set of colours for direct purchase at a
        deterministic price, always:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>above the expected mining cost,</li>
        <li>respecting the Spectral Floor Rule,</li>
        <li>and clearly visible in the UI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This creates a clean relationship between miners (who discover colours)
        and buyers (who assign them high value).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>6. Treasury and long-term stability</h2>
      <p>
        A fraction of licence revenue flows into the <strong>CoolourCoin Treasury</strong>.
        The Treasury can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>hold colours as a long-term reserve,</li>
        <li>pay contributors directly in colours,</li>
        <li>support protocol maintenance and audits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All Treasury movements are transparent. The protocol does not promise yield.
        It only keeps an auditable record of where value goes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>7. What CoolourCoin is not</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is not a leveraged product.</li>
        <li>It is not a yield farm.</li>
        <li>It is not a casino.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        CoolourCoin is a way to park value in unique, uncopyable colours, with a
        floor that cannot be pushed down by panic or manipulation inside the protocol.
